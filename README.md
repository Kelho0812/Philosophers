# Philosophers

**Description:**
The Philosophers project is a simulation of the dining philosophers problem, a classic synchronization and concurrency challenge. It is implemented in C to explore multi-threading and synchronization concepts.

**Features:**
- Simulation of the dining philosophers problem.
- Multi-threading and synchronization in C.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Kelho0812/Philosophers.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Philosophers`
3. Compile the program: `make`
4. Run the simulation with specified arguments: `./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [optional: number_of_times_to_eat]`

**Controls:**
- Adjust simulation parameters as needed.
- The program simulates the dining philosophers problem with the specified parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- This project explores concurrency and synchronization challenges.
- The number of times each philosopher must eat is optional.
- This project is part of the 42Network Curriculum.
